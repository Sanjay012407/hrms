### 2. Fixed Add Certificate Button Pre-fetch ✅

**Problem:** When clicking "Add Certificate" from the profile view page, the certificate creation page didn't pre-select the profile.

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/pages/ProfileDetailView.js` (line 166)
- `frontend/src/pages/CreateCertificate.js` (lines 1-12, 83-114)

**Changes:**
- Modified the "Add Certificate" button to pass profile data via navigation state
- Added useLocation hook to CreateCertificate component
- Added useEffect to pre-fill the profile dropdown and load suggested certificates when coming from ProfileDetailView

### 3. Fixed Job Role Certificate Mapping Issues ✅

**Problem:** Some job roles didn't show all mandatory and alternative certificates due to typos in the mapping file.

**File Modified:** `frontend/src/data/certificateJobRoleMapping.js`

**Fixes Applied:**
1. Line 19: Fixed "Madatory" → "Mandatory" for "Heavy Cabling UG"
2. Line 55: Removed extra comma before "K008" in "Fibre Jointing (Ladder)"
3. Line 113: Fixed "Madatory" → "Mandatory" for "Ribbon Fibre Jointing"

These typos were preventing the certificate suggestion system from correctly identifying mandatory certificates for these job roles.

### 4. Fixed Profile Completion Bar Stuck at 88% ✅

**Problem:** Profile completion bar showed 88% even when all fields were filled.

**File Modified:** `frontend/src/utils/profileCompleteness.js` (lines 32-62)

**Root Cause:** The completion calculation was treating empty objects (like `{ }` for address or emergencyContact) as "filled" when they should be counted as empty.

**Fix:** Enhanced the field validation logic to:
- Check if arrays have length > 0
- Check if objects have at least one non-empty property
- Check if primitive values are non-null, non-undefined, and non-empty strings

This ensures that empty nested objects like `address: {}` or `emergencyContact: {}` are correctly counted as unfilled.

### 5. Fixed Change Button in MyAccount Page ✅

**Problem:** The "Change" button for updating profile pictures wasn't working for admin users.

**File Modified:** `frontend/src/pages/MyAccount.js` (lines 92-142)

**Root Cause:** The code was trying to use `user._id` which may not exist for admin users. It needed to use the profile ID from the fetched profile data.

**Fix:** 
- Changed to use `profile?._id || user?._id` to get the correct profile ID
- Added better error handling with console logging
- Added validation to check if profileId exists before attempting upload
- Updated all references to use the profileId variable consistently

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Superadmin Accounts:** Login with each new account using the credentials above
2. **Add Certificate Pre-fetch:** Navigate to a profile → click "Add Certificate" → verify the profile is pre-selected
3. **Job Role Certificates:** Create certificates for "Heavy Cabling UG" and verify mandatory certificates appear
4. **Profile Completion:** Fill out all admin profile fields and verify it reaches 100%
5. **Profile Picture:** In MyAccount page, click "Change" and upload a new profile picture
