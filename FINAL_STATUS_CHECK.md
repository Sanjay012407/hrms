# Final Status Check - Image Save & Certificate Delete

## Status: ‚úÖ Both Issues FIXED

---

## 1. ‚úÖ Profile Picture in MyAccount - FIXED

### What Was Wrong:
- Upload worked but image didn't refresh immediately
- File size limit was 5MB (backend accepts 10MB)
- getProfileById didn't properly refresh the state

### What Was Fixed:

**File**: `frontend/src/pages/MyAccount.js`

**Changes**:
1. ‚úÖ Increased file size limit to 10MB (matching backend)
2. ‚úÖ Added 'image/jpg' to accepted types
3. ‚úÖ Properly updates local state with new profile picture
4. ‚úÖ Forces page refresh after upload to show new image
5. ‚úÖ Better error messages with details

**How It Works Now**:
```javascript
1. User selects image
2. Validates type (jpeg, png, gif, jpg) and size (10MB)
3. Calls uploadProfilePicture(user._id, file)
4. Backend saves to MongoDB as binary data
5. Updates local state with new picture path
6. Shows success message
7. Auto-refreshes page after 500ms
8. New image appears!
```

**Backend Endpoint** (already working):
```
POST /api/profiles/:id/upload-picture
- Accepts: multipart/form-data with 'profilePicture' field
- Stores: profilePictureData (buffer), profilePictureSize, profilePictureMimeType
- Returns: { profilePicture: '/api/profiles/:id/picture' }

GET /api/profiles/:id/picture
- Returns: The actual image file from database
```

## 2. ‚úÖ Certificate Delete - FIXED

### What Was Wrong:
- Duplicate /api in URLs causing 404 errors
- URLs like: `https://talentshield.co.uk/api/api/certificates/...`

### What Was Fixed:

**File**: `frontend/src/context/CertificateContext.js`

**Changes**:
1. ‚úÖ Imported buildApiUrl utility
2. ‚úÖ Updated fetchCertificates to use buildApiUrl
3. ‚úÖ Updated addCertificate to use buildApiUrl
4. ‚úÖ Updated uploadCertificateFile to use buildApiUrl
5. ‚úÖ Updated deleteCertificate to use buildApiUrl
6. ‚úÖ Added console logging for debugging

**How It Works Now**:
```javascript
// OLD (caused duplicates):
axios.delete(`${API_BASE_URL}/certificates/${id}`)
// If API_BASE_URL = "https://talentshield.co.uk/api"
// Result: https://talentshield.co.uk/api/certificates/... ‚ùå (missing /api)
// OR if code added /api: https://talentshield.co.uk/api/api/... ‚ùå (duplicate)

// NEW (always correct):
const url = buildApiUrl(`/certificates/${id}`);
axios.delete(url);
// Always results in: https://talentshield.co.uk/api/certificates/... ‚úÖ
```

**Backend Endpoint** (already working):
```
DELETE /api/certificates/:id
- Deletes entire certificate (including file)
- Cascade notifications to admins
- Returns: { message: 'Certificate deleted successfully' }

DELETE /api/certificates/:id/file
- Deletes ONLY the file (keeps certificate metadata)
- Returns: { message: 'File deleted', certificate: {...} }
```

---

## 3. ‚úÖ Verification "User Not Found" - FIXED

### What Was Wrong:
- Endpoint required exact token match
- If token didn't match exactly ‚Üí "User not found"
- Already-verified users got confusing error
- No helpful logging

### What Was Fixed:

**File**: `backend/server.js`

**Changes**:
1. ‚úÖ Try exact token match first
2. ‚úÖ If not found, try by email only
3. ‚úÖ Detect already-verified users
4. ‚úÖ Handle gracefully with helpful redirect messages
5. ‚úÖ Comprehensive console logging
6. ‚úÖ Better error messages

**How It Works Now**:
```
User clicks verification link
    ‚Üì
Backend logs: "Email verification request received"
    ‚Üì
Decode JWT token
    ‚Üì
Backend logs: "Token verified for email: user@example.com"
    ‚Üì
Find user in database
    ‚Üì
If user found with token ‚Üí Verify ‚úì
If user found without token but already verified ‚Üí "Already verified" ‚úì
If user not found at all ‚Üí "User not found" message
    ‚Üì
Redirect to login with appropriate message
```

```

---

### Test Certificate Delete (Entire Certificate)

- [ ] Go to Certificates page
- [ ] Click delete on a certificate
- [ ] Confirm deletion
- [ ] Certificate removed from list
- [ ] Backend logs: "Certificate deleted successfully"
- [ ] Refresh page
- [ ] Certificate still gone

**Check Frontend Console**:
```
Deleting certificate: https://talentshield.co.uk/api/certificates/68de1f7b...
Certificate deleted successfully
```

**Should NOT see**:
```
DELETE https://talentshield.co.uk/api/api/certificates/... 404  ‚ùå DUPLICATE /api
```

---

### Test Certificate File Delete (File Only)

- [ ] View a certificate with uploaded file
- [ ] Click "Delete File" button
- [ ] Confirm deletion
- [ ] File removed (certificate metadata remains)
- [ ] Backend logs: "Certificate file deleted successfully"
- [ ] Refresh page
- [ ] File still gone (metadata still there)

**Check Frontend Console**:
```
Deleting certificate file from: https://talentshield.co.uk/api/certificates/68de1f7b.../file
```

**Should NOT see duplicate /api**

---

### Test Email Verification

- [ ] Sign up new user
- [ ] Backend logs: "‚úì Verification email sent to user@example.com"
- [ ] Check email inbox (and spam folder)
- [ ] Click verification link
- [ ] Backend logs: "Email verified successfully for user@example.com"

## üîß Configuration Still Required

### Backend .env (2 Critical Changes):

**File**: `backend/.env`

```env
# Line 26 - MUST CHANGE:
EMAIL_SECURE=true  # Change from 'false' to 'true'

# Line 36 - MUST FIX:
SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL=mvnaveen18@gmail.com  # Remove space before email
```

**Why Critical**:
- `EMAIL_SECURE=false` with port 465 ‚Üí Emails won't send
- Space in email ‚Üí Emails go to wrong address

---

### Frontend .env:

**File**: `frontend/.env`

```env
# Make sure NO /api at the end:
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=https://talentshield.co.uk
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://talentshield.co.uk
```

---

## üêõ If Still Not Working

### Profile Picture Not Saving:

**Check**:
1. Backend console shows: "Profile picture uploaded successfully"?
2. Frontend console shows: "Profile picture uploaded: /api/profiles/..."?
3. Network tab shows 200 response?

**If still failing**:
- Check user._id is defined: `console.log(user._id)`
- Check uploadProfilePicture function in ProfileContext
- Try uploading smaller image (under 1MB) to test

### Certificate Delete Not Working:

**Check Frontend Console**:
```
Deleting certificate: https://talentshield.co.uk/api/certificates/...
```

- Is there duplicate /api? 
- What's the response status?

**Check Backend Console**:
```
Certificate deleted: ... for ...
```

**If 404 error**:
- Frontend .env has /api at end ‚Üí Remove it
- Certificate ID is wrong
- Backend not running

### Verification Still Says "User Not Found":

**Check Backend Console** when clicking link:
```
Email verification request received
Token verified successfully for email: ...
```

**If you don't see these logs**:
- Backend not running
- Wrong backend URL
- Request not reaching backend

**Manual Verification**:
```bash
mongosh
use hrms
db.users.updateOne(
  { email: "user@example.com" },
  { $set: { emailVerified: true } }
)
```

## ‚úÖ Final Verification

Run these commands to verify everything is set up:

```bash
# 1. Check backend .env
cd backend
grep -E "EMAIL_SECURE|SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL" .env

# Should show:
# EMAIL_SECURE=true
# SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL=mvnaveen18@gmail.com

# 2. Test email
node test-email-complete.js

# Should show:
# ‚úì Email sent successfully

# 3. Check frontend .env
cd ../frontend
grep REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL .env

# Should show (NO /api at end):
# REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=https://talentshield.co.uk

# 4. Restart both servers
cd ../backend
npm start
# In another terminal:
cd ../frontend  
npm start
```

**All fixes are in place!** Just need to update .env files and restart.
