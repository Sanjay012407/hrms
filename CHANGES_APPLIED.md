# Changes Applied - HRMS System

## Overview
This document summarizes all the changes made to fix file storage, data persistence, authorization flows, and user creation functionality.

---

## 1. File Storage & Data Persistence ✅

### Problem
- Certificates and profile pictures were being uploaded but not persisting after page refresh
- Data was lost because files weren't properly stored in the database

### Solution
**Backend Changes:**
- ✅ Modified certificate GET endpoints to exclude binary data (`fileData`) for performance
  - `GET /api/certificates` - excludes fileData
  - `GET /api/certificates/:id` - excludes fileData
  - Files retrieved via separate endpoint: `GET /api/certificates/:id/file`

- ✅ Certificate create endpoint properly stores files in MongoDB:
  ```javascript
  certificateData.certificateFile = req.file.originalname;
  certificateData.fileData = req.file.buffer;
  certificateData.fileSize = req.file.size;
  certificateData.mimeType = req.file.mimetype;
  ```

- ✅ Certificate update endpoint supports file updates via `PUT /api/certificates/:id/upload`

- ✅ Profile picture endpoints work correctly:
  - Upload: `POST /api/profiles/:id/upload-picture`
  - Retrieve: `GET /api/profiles/:id/picture`
  - Stores: profilePictureData (buffer), profilePictureSize, profilePictureMimeType

**Frontend Context:**
- Already correctly configured to upload files via FormData
- Already correctly configured to retrieve files via API endpoints

---

## 2. View, Edit, Delete Operations ✅

### Certificates
- ✅ **View**: `GET /api/certificates/:id` returns certificate metadata
- ✅ **View File**: `GET /api/certificates/:id/file` serves the actual file
- ✅ **Edit**: `PUT /api/certificates/:id` updates metadata
- ✅ **Edit with File**: `PUT /api/certificates/:id/upload` updates file
- ✅ **Delete**: `DELETE /api/certificates/:id` removes certificate and notifies admins

### Profiles
- ✅ **View**: `GET /api/profiles/:id` returns profile (without binary data for performance)
- ✅ **View Complete**: `GET /api/profiles/:id/complete` returns full profile with binary data
- ✅ **View Picture**: `GET /api/profiles/:id/picture` serves profile picture
- ✅ **Edit**: `PUT /api/profiles/:id` updates profile data
- ✅ **Upload Picture**: `POST /api/profiles/:id/upload-picture` updates profile picture
- ✅ **Delete**: `DELETE /api/profiles/:id` cascade deletes:
  - Profile document
  - All associated certificates
  - Associated user account (if exists)
  - Creates notifications for admins

---

## 3. Admin Authorization Flow ✅

### Problem
- New admin signups had no approval process
- Anyone could create admin accounts without oversight

### Solution Implemented

**Signup Process (`POST /api/auth/signup`):**
```javascript
// When role === 'admin':
1. User created with adminApprovalStatus: 'pending'
2. Verification token generated and stored
3. Admin approval token generated and stored
4. Email verification link sent to user's email
5. Admin approval request sent to SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL
```

**Email Verification (`GET /api/auth/verify-email`):**
- User clicks link in email
- Sets `emailVerified: true`
- Clears verification token
- Admin users still need approval before login

**Admin Approval (`GET /api/auth/approve-admin`):**
- Super admin clicks link in approval email
- Sets `adminApprovalStatus: 'approved'`
- Sets `emailVerified: true` (auto-verify on approval)
- Clears admin approval token
- Admin can now log in

**Login Enforcement (`POST /api/auth/login`):**
```javascript
// Checks enforced:
1. Account exists ✓
2. Password correct ✓
3. Account active ✓
4. Email verified ✓
5. Admin approval (for admin users) ✓
```

**Configuration:**
- Set `SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL` in backend/.env (defaults to admin@talentshield.com)
- Approval enforced in all environments (not just production)

---

## 4. Create User Functionality ✅

### Problem
- Credentials were being sent to the NEW USER's email
- Security concern: credentials sent over email to unverified addresses
- Better practice: credentials sent to CREATING ADMIN

### Solution Implemented

**New Email Functions Created:**

1. **`sendAdminNewUserCredentialsEmail(adminEmail, newUserName, newUserEmail, newUserPassword, loginUrl)`**
   - Sends credentials to the admin who created the user
   - Includes: new user's name, email, and generated password
   - Styled email with clear instructions for admin

2. **`sendWelcomeEmailToNewUser(userEmail, userName, loginUrl)`**
   - Sends welcome email to newly created user
   - Does NOT include credentials
   - Informs user that admin will provide credentials
   - Includes security tips

**Updated Create User Endpoint (`POST /api/users/create`):**
```javascript
1. Admin authenticates (session/JWT required)
2. Validates input (firstName, lastName, email)
3. Checks user doesn't already exist
4. Generates secure random password (8 characters)
5. Creates Profile document with password
6. Sends credentials to CREATING ADMIN's email ← KEY CHANGE
7. Sends welcome email to NEW USER (without credentials)
8. Returns success response (without password)
```

**Security Improvements:**
- Credentials never included in response JSON
- Admin receives credentials in their own email
- Admin shares credentials with new user through secure channel
- New user notified but doesn't receive credentials via email

**`backend/server.js`:**
- Added missing imports for password generator and email utilities
- Removed duplicate imports
- Fixed certificate GET endpoints to exclude binary data
- Updated create user endpoint to send emails to admin

## 9. Database Schema Notes

### Certificate Schema
```javascript
{
  certificate: String,
  category: String,
  profileId: ObjectId,
  certificateFile: String,       // Original filename
  fileData: Buffer,              // Binary file data
  fileSize: Number,              // File size in bytes
  mimeType: String,              // MIME type
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Profile Schema
```javascript
{
  firstName: String,
  lastName: String,
  email: String,
  profilePicture: String,        // URL path
  profilePictureData: Buffer,    // Binary image data
  profilePictureSize: Number,    // Image size in bytes
  profilePictureMimeType: String,// MIME type
  vtid: Number,                  // Auto-generated 1000-9000
  skillkoId: Number,             // Auto-generated random 4-digit
  // ... other fields
}
```

### User Schema
```javascript
{
  firstName: String,
  lastName: String,
  email: String,
  password: String,              // Bcrypt hashed
  role: String,                  // 'user' or 'admin'
  emailVerified: Boolean,
  verificationToken: String,
  adminApprovalStatus: String,   // 'pending' or 'approved'
  adminApprovalToken: String,
  // ... other fields
}
```

## 10. Security Enhancements

1. ✅ Passwords hashed with bcrypt (10 rounds)
2. ✅ JWT tokens for authentication
3. ✅ Session-based authentication with MongoDB store
4. ✅ Email verification required for all users
5. ✅ Admin approval required for admin accounts
6. ✅ Credentials sent to creating admin, not new user
7. ✅ File size limits enforced (10MB)
8. ✅ Input validation on all endpoints
9. ✅ Authenticated routes protected with middleware
10. ✅ CORS configured properly

---

## 11. Known Limitations & Recommendations

### Current Limitations
- Files stored in MongoDB (works but not ideal for very large files)
- No file type validation beyond MIME type
- No virus scanning on uploads

### Recommendations for Production
1. **File Storage**: Consider migrating to GridFS or S3 for better scalability
2. **File Validation**: Add stricter file type validation
3. **Security**: Add virus scanning for uploaded files
4. **Monitoring**: Add logging and monitoring for file uploads
5. **Backup**: Ensure MongoDB backups include binary data
6. **Performance**: Consider CDN for serving profile pictures
7. **Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting to upload endpoints

---

## 12. Rollback Instructions

If you need to rollback these changes:

1. Revert `backend/server.js`:
   ```bash
   git checkout HEAD -- backend/server.js
   ```

2. Revert `backend/utils/emailService.js`:
   ```bash
   git checkout HEAD -- backend/utils/emailService.js
   ```

3. Remove new documentation files:
   ```bash

## Success Criteria

All features now work as expected:
- ✅ Certificates persist after upload and refresh
- ✅ Profile pictures persist after upload and refresh
- ✅ View, edit, delete work for both profiles and certificates
- ✅ Admin signup requires email verification AND super admin approval
- ✅ Create user sends credentials to creating admin (not new user)
- ✅ All CRUD operations create appropriate notifications
- ✅ Cascade deletes work properly
- ✅ Files stored securely in database
- ✅ API responses optimized (binary data excluded from lists)
